## MVP for "Echoes" startup

<br/>

For end-of-study project at the **[Le Reacteur](https://www.lereacteur.io/)** bootcamp, we created an MVP for the French startup **Echoes**. We were a 4-year-old team and this was the first time we worked as a team.

On this project I mainly took care of all the identification and creation of account (login, signup, lost password and sending email).

The front is hosted on **Netlify** and the back is hosted on **Heroku**. The back office is managed with **Forestadmin**.

## Demo 🖥

<a href="https://echoes-demo.netlify.app/">**Try it!**</a>

You can test the website, either by creating a new account or by using these credentials

```
Admin : demo@mail.com
Password : demo
```

<br/>

If you want to test the **Stripe** payment method, you just have to fill in each field with a sequence of 42.

```
Card Number : 4242424242424242
Date : 04/24
Security Code : 242
Postcode : 42424
```
